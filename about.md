Brian Leonard is a Solutions Architect at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) where he is responsible for helping customers gain a competitive advantage through the design of agile, reliable and scalable systems. Prior to joining MongoDB, Brian served in many engineering roles at Sun Microsystems and Oracle, working closely with application servers, developer tools, operating systems, middleware and finally cloud platform solutions, especially those focused on application development.

Brian tries to spend all of his free time hanging out with his 3 awesome kids, in fear of the day they wake-up and decide he's no longer cool enough to hang out with.
